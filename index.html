                today was a fun day; did a lot! :pumpkin_cat:
                apolagies for not giving previous entries the other days, I usually save entries to the end of the day — and that means by then im often way too tired to actually post anything ૮ – ﻌ–აᶻ 𝗓 𐰁
                
                but hey! still did a lot, and it's also getting closer to halloween! so thats great :-3

                [img https://assets.vivwebz.net/20251012_140903.jpg] here's what I had for lunch :-3 very delicious, it's a mix of brioche toast and maple syrup so nothing special but I love it ^^

                we did some relaxing (kinda) just looking around this map titled "Atmospheric Halloween" - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3050695713
                and then we played the hidden on it lmao which was cool! (it was buggy and basically none of us had any idea what we were doing :sus:)

                [img https://assets.vivwebz.net/Screenshot_2025-10-12_233116.png] there was also a new update to atlyss today which added like a bunch of new stuff, I don't really know content wise because I'm not that deep into the game and kinda just go around dungeons but they changed the whole map and hud ui, added icons on the main menu, and changed pretty much every map in the game to make it easier to move around and I guess just adding small attention to detail ૮ ᴖﻌᴖა

                [img https://assets.vivwebz.net/20251011_171218.jpg] I also got a new guitar yesterday (electric guitar) — kinda just trying to learn a few songs, practice and all, getting a feel for everything, but yea its fun ^^
                im not super serious about it or anything, I don't really want to dive into lessons and such, just kinda like to play stuff whenever I feel like it at my own pace (similar to what I did with ukulele)

                and yea, thats basically it — happy halloween! and goodnight for me :-3 (TEXT FORMATTING SOON I SWEAR AS LONG AS I REMEMBER)
